### Exploratory Data Analysis Insights:
## Objective: The primary aim was to conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to decipher supplier demand, revenue trends, and factors influencing consumer preferences in product selection.

## Tools Used

SAS EG

SAS Viya

## Dataset Overview:

*Invoice:* Contains 24,214 unique transactions (baskets).

*Basket:* Links 418,771 transactions (baskets) to the respective products.

*Customers:* Includes data on 10,000 unique customers.

*Products:* Encompasses details of 144 unique products.

## Key Highlights

*Age Range Transformation:* To enhance the analysis of age, it would be beneficial to categorize ages into specific age brackets (Very Young, Young, Middle Age, Mature, Old, Very Old). With this categorization, 
a more organized result emerges: Middle age customers represent 37.09%, followed by the Young group at 30.21%, while the Very Young group comprises 18.20%, showing a clearer breakdown of age segments.

*Top Product per Product Type & Market Share:* The analysis focuses on identifying the top-selling product within each category and its market share compared to other products within the same category. The results reveal significant products like Hailstorm Steel Woods Set, Course Pro Umbrella, and Hailstorm Steer Irons, each occupying a quarter of sales (25% - 26%) in their respective categories. Moreover, the Husky Rope 60 Blue Steel Max Putter dominates its category with a substantial 34% market share. Notably, within categories like watches and eyewear, while the top products hold a small share (8% and 6% respectively), the categories themselves constitute a significant portion of total sales 
(9% and 11% respectively), indicating broader diversity in those categories despite individual product dominance. This analysis provides insights into both product-specific and category-wide market dynamics.

*Maps Creation and integration with other Datasets:* Analyzed loss rates by connecting demographic density, observed significant loss rates in specific areas, and created a Tile Chart to depict these relationships.
Generated maps in Viya using longitude and latitude data from the Query_for_loss_Perc table, establishing a Geo-Hierarchy based on Country and Region levels for spatial analysis.

## In-depth Insights:

#### Sales Patterns:

- **Weekday Sales Trends**: Increased sales observed from Tuesday to Friday, indicating higher sales in receipts issued, total products sold, and overall sales value.

- **Friday Surges**: Potential consumer purchases aimed at utilizing leisure time over the weekend, attributed to the store selling various hobby-related items.

- **Lowest Sales Days**: Monday and Saturday, likely due to:

  - **Monday Effect**: Individuals starting their workweek, less time for online shopping.
 
  - **Weekend Activities**: Saturdays associated with outdoor activities and family time, reducing time for online shopping.

#### Consumer Behavior by Weekday:

- **Average Basket Size per Weekday**: Notable observation: Friday, Saturday, and Tuesday have the highest average basket sizes. 

- **Saturday's Impact**: Despite lower sales counts, products sold on Saturdays contribute significantly more to the overall revenue due to higher average basket sizes.

#### Operational Recommendations:

- **Targeted Campaigns**: Suggested focused email marketing campaigns on Mondays and especially Saturdays, capitalizing on consumer interest and high-value products.

- **Increased Sales Strategy**: Proposed efforts to boost sales on these specific days through targeted marketing initiatives aligning with consumer preferences.
