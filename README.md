# Analyzing Real-World POS Data: Unveiling Consumer Behavior & Strategic Insights using SAS Software

The present work entails a comprehensive analysis of real sales data from XYZ Company located in Brazil, specializing in retail products related to hobbies like camping, golf, and more. This analysis employs exploratory methods alongside machine learning techniques, including RFM analysis (clustering), market basket analysis, and prediction using decision trees. Leveraging the capabilities of SAS Viya & SAS EG tools, this study extracts valuable insights from the data, uncovering patterns and trends critical for informed strategic decision-making.


[**Exploratory Analysis**](https://github.com/moraitis-alexandros/Analyzing-Real-World-POS-Data-Unveiling-Consumer-Behavior-and-Strategic-Insights-using-SAS-Software/blob/main/Exploratory_Data_Analysis.md)

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) encompassed a comprehensive investigation into sales dynamics, including detailed insights into sales levels across diverse product types. It delved into returns, calculating total monetary value and introducing the novel Loss Rate metric, shedding light on product inefficiencies impacting revenue. Analysis identified top-performing products per type, examined market share, mapped regional revenue distribution, and assessed supplier demand. Additionally, it explored variations in average basket size across weekdays, providing key insights into consumer behavior. The creation of new metrics like the Loss Rate enriched the analytical framework, empowering strategic decision-making for revenue optimization and operational enhancements at XYZ company.

[**RFM Analysis**](https://github.com/moraitis-alexandros/Analyzing-Real-World-POS-Data-Unveiling-Consumer-Behavior-and-Strategic-Insights-using-SAS-Software/blob/main/RFM-Analysis)

The enriched RFM analysis, segmented customers into four categories - Best (48.6%), First Timer (17.6%), Churner (28%), and Hibernating (19.7%). This segmentation, coupled with age-based clusters and new metrics like Weighted Churn Rate and Weighted Best Rate, pinpointed regions with high churners and concentrations of best customers. These insights paved the way for targeted strategies, emphasizing increasing the share of Best customers while addressing the challenge of high churn rates. Exploring potential correlations between churners and returns also provided actionable insights for product/service enhancements, contributing to XYZ company's refined targeting, retention, and satisfaction initiatives.

[**Market Basket Analysis**](https://github.com/moraitis-alexandros/Analyzing-Real-World-POS-Data-Unveiling-Consumer-Behavior-and-Strategic-Insights-using-SAS-Software/blob/main/Market-Basket-Analysis)

Identified pivotal products influencing sales, which collectively contributed to a substantial portion of total sales.

[**Decision Tree Analysis**](https://github.com/moraitis-alexandros/Analyzing-Real-World-POS-Data-Unveiling-Consumer-Behavior-and-Strategic-Insights-using-SAS-Software/blob/main/Decision-Tree-Analysis)

Predicted customer category 97 purchases to strategically allocate discount coupons, significantly enhancing buyer predictions by 2,9758 times compared to a basic model.
