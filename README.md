# Analyzing Real-World POS Data: Unveiling Consumer Behavior & Strategic Insights using SAS Software

The present work presents a comprehensive analysis of real sales data from company XYZ, using exploratory analysis as well as machine learning techniques such as RFM analysis (clustering), market basket analysis, and conducting predictions using a decision tree. The study leverages the capabilities of **SAS Viya & SAS EG** tools to extract valuable insights from the data and discover patterns and trends that can influence strategic decision-making.

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) encompassed a comprehensive investigation into sales dynamics, including detailed insights into sales levels across diverse product types. It delved into returns, calculating total monetary value and introducing the novel Loss Rate metric, shedding light on product inefficiencies impacting revenue. Analysis identified top-performing products per type, examined market share, mapped regional revenue distribution, and assessed supplier demand. Additionally, it explored variations in average basket size across weekdays, providing key insights into consumer behavior. The creation of new metrics like the Loss Rate enriched the analytical framework, empowering strategic decision-making for revenue optimization and operational enhancements at XYZ company.

The enhanced RFM analysis integrated age-based clusters, refining segmentation for targeted strategies. New metrics like Weighted Churn Rate and Weighted Best Rate spotlighted regions with high churners and concentrations of best customers, guiding tailored retention efforts and market expansion. Exploration into churners and returns correlation unearthed potential connections, offering actionable insights for product/service enhancements to mitigate churn risk. This enriched RFM approach empowers XYZ company with precise targeting and strategic direction to optimize retention, expansion, and customer satisfaction initiatives.

[**Market Basket Analysis**](https://github.com/moraitis-alexandros/Analyzing-Real-World-POS-Data-Unveiling-Consumer-Behavior-and-Strategic-Insights-using-SAS-Software/blob/main/Market-Basket-Analysis)

Identified pivotal products influencing sales, such as Hailstorm Steel Woods Set, Course Pro Umbrella, and Husky Rope 60, which collectively contributed to a substantial portion of total sales.

[**Decision Tree Analysis**](https://github.com/moraitis-alexandros/Analyzing-Real-World-POS-Data-Unveiling-Consumer-Behavior-and-Strategic-Insights-using-SAS-Software/blob/main/Decision-Tree-Analysis)

Predicted customer category 97 purchases to strategically allocate discount coupons, significantly enhancing buyer predictions by 2,9758 times compared to a basic model.
