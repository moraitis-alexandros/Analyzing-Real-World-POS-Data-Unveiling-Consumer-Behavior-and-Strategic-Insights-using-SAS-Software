The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) encompassed a comprehensive investigation into sales dynamics, including detailed insights into sales levels across diverse product types. It delved into returns, calculating total monetary value and introducing the novel Loss Rate metric, shedding light on product inefficiencies impacting revenue. Analysis identified top-performing products per type, examined market share, mapped regional revenue distribution, and assessed supplier demand. Additionally, it explored variations in average basket size across weekdays, providing key insights into consumer behavior. The creation of new metrics like the Loss Rate enriched the analytical framework, empowering strategic decision-making for revenue optimization and operational enhancements at XYZ company.

## Exploratory Data Analysis Insights:

## Objective: 

The primary aim was to conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to decipher supplier demand, revenue trends, and factors influencing consumer preferences in product selection. The characteristics of the customer base were identified through exploratory analysis and various visualization methods. The breakdown showed a gender distribution of 70.07% male and 29.93% female. Key age groups were middle-aged individuals (36-50) at 37.09% and the young (26-35) at 30.21%. The primary regions of origin were RJ, MG, PR, RS. It was noted that returns amounted to $3,178,087.90 (15.95%) against sales of $16,752,418.20 (84.05%). The average basket size was determined at $959.58, with an average of 14 products per basket. Significantly popular products included the Hailstorm Steel Woods Set, Course Pro Umbrella, and Hailstorm Steer Irons, accounting for a quarter (25%-26%) of sales, as well as the Husky Rope 60 and Blue Steel Max Putter, occupying 34% within their category. Notably, watches and eyewear categories had top products with smaller individual shares (8% and 6%, respectively), yet these categories collectively represented a substantial portion of total sales (9% and 11%, respectively). Supplier analysis revealed Dragon SA (22.40%) and Toktai & Chen (16.54%) as the most in-demand, with products from India and the US leading in revenue.

## Tools Used

SAS EG

SAS Viya

## Dataset Overview:

- *Invoice*: 20,692 unique transactions (baskets)

- *Basket*: 312,537 entries connecting transactions (baskets) with products

- *Customers*: 8,584 unique customers

- *Products*: 144 unique items

Sales and returns are adjusted:

  - *Sales*: $17,458
    
  - *Returns*: $3,234
    
  - *Total*: 20,692 entries post-cleaning.

## Feature Engineering

*Data Cleaning:* In the process of data cleaning and age filtering, customer ages were calculated and subsequently filtered to ensure logical values. The data cleaning phase involved removing entries with birth years earlier than 1910 (considered overage) or later than 2001 (considered underage), contributing to a refined dataset.

*Generate Age Attribute:* Conversion of the birth date to a date format, the creation of a new variable counting the days passed since that date, and the calculation of age using functions, the birth date column is then removed to derive the rounded age. The code also takes into account leap years

*Age Range Transformation:* To enhance the analysis of age, it would be beneficial to categorize ages into specific age brackets (Very Young, Young, Middle Age, Mature, Old, Very Old). With this categorization, 
a more organized result emerges: Middle age customers represent 37.09%, followed by the Young group at 30.21%, while the Very Young group comprises 18.20%, showing a clearer breakdown of age segments.

*Top Product per Product Type & Market Share:* Developed a code snippet in SAS EG in order to examine top-selling products in each category, highlighting significant items, each occupying important share of their respective category's sales. Also highlight products that stand out with substantial market shares. Notably, while certain top products within some categories hold smaller shares, but collectively contribute significantly to overall sales, showcasing diversity despite individual product dominance. This analysis sheds light on both specific product performance and broader category trends in the market.

### Supplier Analysis:

![Suppliers](images/supplier.png)

üìç Dragon SA leads in sales with 47,853 units, followed by Toktai & Chen at 43,543 units. However Toktai & Chen products are included in more invoices. This fact makes him the supplier with the highest demand.

üìç Carper n Sons, with an average of 13 unique codes, sells fewer products than Fabulo Ltd with 11 codes. This indicates lower consumer preference for Carper n Sons' products, prompting a need for quality checks and potential packaging improvements.

üìç Carper n Sons' products show lower demand despite higher value, necessitating further investigations into functionality, packaging, and price-quality relationships.

üìç Implementing electronic reviews to customers who purchased or returned Carper n Sons' products could offer deeper insights, especially if targeted towards better customer segments identified through RFM analysis for improved feedback and understanding of low demand reasons (price, product quality, or packaging).

### Product Origin Analysis:

![Suppliers](images/country.png)

üìç Turkish Product Revenue: Lower total revenues indicate potential consumer disinterest or lower pricing. Unlike Chinese products, Turkish items lack consumer preference despite similar pricing.

üìç Indian Product Lead: Despite lower individual values compared to similar US-made items, Indian products attract consumers due to a better quantity-price balance, securing the top position in revenue.

üìç US Product Appeal: Despite higher unit values compared to counterparts, US products rank second in revenue, favored for their quality-price equilibrium.



### Operational Suggestions:

#### Operational Recommendations:

- **Targeted Campaigns**: Suggested focused email marketing campaigns on Mondays and especially Saturdays, capitalizing on consumer interest and high-value products.

- **Increased Sales Strategy**: Proposed efforts to boost sales on these specific days through targeting

- **Minimize Turkish Offerings:** Consider reducing Turkish products due to potential consumer mismatch.
  
- **Highlight Indian Selections:** Focus on Indian products for customers seeking multiple reasonably priced items, especially during promotions.

- **Promote US Merchandise:** Emphasize US products for consumers valuing quality at a reasonable price. This aligns with discerning the best customer segments through subsequent RFM analysis.
